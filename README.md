# SPJ - Space Project (yeah...)

Small demo space SHMUP for the Dreamcast. Uses KallistiOS and SH4ZAM.

The code here should not be considered as a reference for anything good. It's god awful and is the product of hacking around to get used to KOS, SH4ZAM and the PVR.

## Build Instructions

> git submodule update --init --recursive

For emulator:
> make emu

For dc-load:
> make run

## Special Thanks

- Falco Girgis (Gyrovorbis) for sh4zam and the 1000 other examples of using the pvr
- sizious and nextgeniuspro for libadx
- KallistiOS contributors
